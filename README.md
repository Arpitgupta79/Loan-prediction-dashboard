# Loan-prediction-dashboard
This project presents a Loan Approval Prediction Dashboard designed using Streamlit, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Plotly. The system aims to automate loan approval decisions based on key financial parameters. The methodology involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation using machine learning models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression. The dashboard provides interactive insights, predictive analytics, and user-friendly visualizations. Future enhancements include deploying the model online, integrating real-time data, and improving model performance with deep learning techniques.
